# Movies-ETL

The purpose of the movies ETL project is to practice the Extract - Transform - Load method of data analysis. Movie data and ratings are extracted from Wikipedia and Kaggle. The data is then transformed to creat tables without redundancies and incomplete data. The data is then loaded onto a SQL server as a table.
